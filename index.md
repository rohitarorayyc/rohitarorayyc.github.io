## About Me

I'm a first year PhD Student @ Harvard studying [bioinformatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/phd-program/big-phd-track). I'm broady interested in AI for science, drug discovery, and protien design. 

Currently, I'm rotating in the [Marks lab](https://www.deboramarkslab.com) studying functional protien design. Before that, I was a rotation student in the [Church lab](https://churchlab.hms.harvard.edu) working on therapies for aging. 

In undergrad, I worked under the [Biernaskie lab](https://vet.ucalgary.ca/labs/biernaskie/home?utm_source=biernaskie&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=redirect) finding regenerative medicine therapies studying animals like reindeer, and the [Bose lab](https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/departments/bmb/profiles/dr-pinaki-bose) studying the spatial architecture of tumors.
