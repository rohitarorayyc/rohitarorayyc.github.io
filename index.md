## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student at Harvard studying [Bioinformatics](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/phd-program/big-phd-track). My interests span across artificial intelligence for scientific research, with a focus on drug discovery and protein design.

Currently, I'm rotating in the [Marks lab](https://www.deboramarkslab.com) and joining Genentech this summer to work in the [Regev lab](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/aviv-regev).
